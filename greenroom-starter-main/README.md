You're looking at a working but mediocre product. It's enough to feel real, but every workflow has gaps. **Your job isn't to fix everything — it's to pick a slice and design it well.** See your case study brief for full instructions.

## Before you start

You'll need:

1. **Node.js, version 20 or higher** — get it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) (pick the LTS version). Verify with `node -v`.
2. **Git** — most computers have it. Verify with `git --version`. If not, install from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
3. **A code editor.** [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is great. [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) is what we'd reach for if we were doing this case study.
4. **A GitHub account.** Free at [github.com](https://github.com/).

If you're on Windows, run all the commands below in **Git Bash**, **PowerShell**, or **WSL** — not the legacy Command Prompt.

## Setup, step by step

### 1. Fork this repo to your own GitHub account

Click the **Fork** button at the top right of [https://github.com/samay-cbh/greenroom-starter](https://github.com/samay-cbh/greenroom-starter). You'll get a copy under your own username.

> _Why fork?_ A fork is your own copy of the repo. You'll commit your changes there, and submit your fork's URL when you're done. We can see your commit history that way.

### 2. Clone your fork to your computer

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/greenroom-starter
cd greenroom-starter
```

(Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.)

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This pulls down all the JavaScript packages the project needs. Takes about 60 seconds. You may see a few warnings — those are normal and safe to ignore.

### 4. Start the app

```bash
npm run dev
```

You'll see something like:

```
▲ Next.js 16.x
- Local:   http://localhost:3000

✓ Ready in 1.2s
```

### 5. Open it in your browser

Go to **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**.

You'll land on Mariana's home view at The Crescent. **Click "Where to start" in the sidebar** for an in-product orientation.

> **Tip:** Press **⌘K** (Mac) or **Ctrl+K** (Windows/Linux) anywhere in the app to open the command palette — search across shows and artists instantly.

---

## What's running

You're logged in automatically as **Mariana Reyes**, lead booker at The Crescent (650-cap, Nashville). The product has these surfaces:

| Route | What it is |
|---|---|
| `/shows` | Mariana's home view. 24 months of completed shows, searchable and grouped by month. |
| `/shows/[id]` | Show detail. Deal terms, artist info, ticket sales, expenses, comps. |
| `/shows/[id]/settle` | The in-app settlement worksheet. **Try it on a few shows.** |
| `/artists` | Roster of artists who've played the venue, bucketed by frequency. |
| `/reports` | Aggregate metrics. The numbers Pri (the CEO) is watching. |
| `/context` | Orientation for you, the candidate. Linked from the sidebar. |

### Recommended path your first time through

1. Open `/context` (the sidebar's "Where to start" link). 5-minute tour.
2. Then `/shows`. Pick a Vs-deal show. Click **Settle**. See what's broken.
3. Pick a Flat-deal show. Click **Settle**. See what works.
4. Read `data/transcripts/*.md` and `data/ceo-memo.md`.
5. Look at `data/dispute-thread.md`. Then press **⌘K** and search "Coastal Spell" to find the matching show.

## How the data is shaped

Twenty-four months of synthetic operational data, designed to feel like a real venue:

| Table | Approx rows | What it represents |
|---|---|---|
| `shows` | ~540 | 24 months of shows. The app displays only past shows (more appear as days pass). |
| `artists` | 59 | Mix of recurring (A-tier, 4+ shows) and one-off (D-tier) acts |
| `agents` | 14 | Across WME, CAA, Wasserman, Paradigm, and independents |
| `deals` | ~540 | One per show. Mix is flat ~33%, vs ~33%, % of net ~24%, door ~5%, % of gross ~4% |
| `ticket_sales` | ~540 | One summary row per show, with realistic sell-through distributions |
| `comps` | ~1,900 | Comp tickets across 6 categories |
| `expenses` | ~2,900 | Sound, lights, hospitality, marketing, production, backline |
| `settlements` | ~540 | All shows have settlement data. Past shows display it; future shows hold it until their date arrives. |

A few things worth knowing:

**The deal `notes_freetext` field is the truth.** The structured fields (`guarantee_amount`, `percentage`, `bonuses_json`, `expense_cap`) are filled inconsistently. Mariana enters deals as prose because the structured fields don't model the actual deals well. This mismatch is part of the realism.

**Vs deals come in flavors.** About a third of Vs deals are "standard." The rest mix in walkout pots, tier ratchets, and vs-gross variants. The current in-app tool can't settle most of these.

**Settlements have a lifecycle.** The state machine runs draft → submitted → in_review → signed (or disputed) → revised → finalized → paid → voided.

**Recoups are categorized.** Settlement records carry a `recoups_json` field with line items in categories like `marketing`, `hospitality_overage`, `production_overage`. Each can be `agreed`, `disputed`, or `withdrawn`.

---

## A note before you start

Real venue data is messy. Fields drift over time. Prose contradicts structured values. Statuses don't always match the underlying reality. Patterns hide across many shows that look unremarkable in isolation. **What the UI shows you isn't always what the data says — and neither is necessarily what actually happened.**

We'd encourage you to read the data closely, query `data/greenroom.db` directly, and bring skepticism to anything that seems clean. The candidates we hire are the ones who notice that the surface-level view is incomplete.

---

## Where to look for context

```
data/
├── ceo-memo.md            # Pri's Q4 memo: "winning on completeness, losing on craft"
├── dispute-thread.md      # The March 2025 marketing-recoup dispute, in full
├── greenroom.db           # SQLite database — pre-seeded, ready to go
└── transcripts/
    ├── mariana.md         # 30-min interview with the booker
    ├── diego.md           # Tour manager perspective
    ├── marcus.md          # GM perspective
    └── sarah-kim.md       # Agent perspective (WME)
```

These aren't decorative. They contain signals the database deliberately doesn't capture — Mariana's frustrations, the agent's pet peeves, the things that escalate disputes. Mine them.

## Tech stack

- **Next.js 16** (App Router) + **React 19** + **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS 4** with shadcn-style component primitives
- **Drizzle ORM** + **libsql** (pure-JS SQLite — no native compile, no setup)
- **Fraunces** (variable serif, via `next/font/google`) for display headings
- **Geist Sans / Mono** (self-hosted via the `geist` package) for body + code
- **lucide-react** for icons, **date-fns** for dates

Everything is deliberately conventional. Use Cursor, Claude Code, or any other AI tool to navigate and modify the codebase — we expect you to.

## How to submit

When you're done:

1. **Push your branch.** `git add . && git commit -m "your message" && git push`
2. **Send the hiring contact:**
   - The link to your forked repo
   - Your 3–5 page PRD-quality memo (PDF, Notion, or Google Doc)
   - A 5–10 minute Loom walking us through the prototype and memo together

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Command not found: npm" or "node is not recognized"

Node.js isn't installed (or isn't on your PATH). Install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/), then restart your terminal.

### "Port 3000 is already in use"

Something else is using port 3000. Two options:

**Stop the other thing first.**
- Mac/Linux: `lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9`
- Windows: `netstat -ano | findstr :3000` then `taskkill /PID <pid> /F`

**Or run on a different port:**
```bash
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

### "Module not found" or weird build errors

Your `node_modules` is probably corrupt or incomplete. Reset it:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### The database looks empty, or you broke the data while exploring

Reset the database:

```bash
npm run db:reset
```

This drops the SQLite file and regenerates 24 months of data. Takes ~5 seconds. Deterministic — same data every time.

### Page looks ugly or buttons aren't visible

Hard-refresh your browser to clear the CSS cache:
- Mac: **⌘ + Shift + R**
- Windows/Linux: **Ctrl + Shift + R**

### "I want to see what's actually in the database"

```bash
npm run db:studio
```

Opens [Drizzle Studio](https://orm.drizzle.team/drizzle-studio/overview) at `local.drizzle.studio` — a visual table browser. You can also open `data/greenroom.db` with any SQLite client (e.g. [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/), [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/), or `sqlite3` CLI).

### Anything else

If you're stuck, email the hiring contact. We'd rather you ask than burn an hour fighting a setup issue.
